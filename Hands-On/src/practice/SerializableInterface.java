		/* Serialization in Java is the process of converting an object into a byte stream to save it to a file, send it over a network, or store it in a database. The object can later be deserialized to recreate the original object.

		Steps to Handle Serialization:
		
		Implement the Serializable interface in the class.
		Use ObjectOutputStream to write the object to a file.
		Use ObjectInputStream to read the object from a file. */
